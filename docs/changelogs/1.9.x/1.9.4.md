# Version 1.9.4

```md
## How to update
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.9.4`.
```

## üåã IMPORTANT üåã
- This update integrates pret's latest Makefile changes, which rearranges the entire file in order to speed up compilation times overall. If you did any changes to it (such as installing Poryscript) and are having issues resolving the conflicts, keep expansion's version of Makefile and reapply your changes afterwards.
